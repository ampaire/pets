DOG INHERITANCE
This is an OOP

Create a Pets class that holds instances of dogs; this class is completely separate from the Dog class. In other words, the Dog class does not inherit from the Pets class. Then assign three dog instances to an instance of the Pets class. Save the file as pets_class.py. Your output should look like this:
I have 3 dogs. 
Tom is 6. 
Fletcher is 7. 
Larry is 9. 
And they're all mammals, of course.
    
HUNGRY DOGS

Using the same file, add an instance attribute of is_hungry = True to the Dog class. Then add a method called eat() which changes the value of is_hungry to False when called. Figure out the best way to feed each dog and then output “My dogs are hungry.” if all are hungry or “My dogs are not hungry.” if all are not hungry. The final output should look like this:
I have 3 dogs. 
Tom is 6. 
Fletcher is 7. 
Larry is 9. 
And they're all mammals, of course. 
My dogs are not hungry.

DOG WALKING

Next, add a walk() method to both the Pets and Dog classes so that when you call the method on the Pets class, each dog instance assigned to the Pets class will walk(). Save this as dog_walking.py. This is slightly more difficult.
Start by implementing the method in the same manner as the speak() method. As for the method in the Pets class, you will need to iterate through the list of dogs, then call the method itself.
The output should look like this:
Tom is walking!
Fletcher is walking!
Larry is walking!
